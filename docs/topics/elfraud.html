<h1>Election Fraud 2020</h1>

<p>
<b>Fox News reported that Dominion Voting Systems' machines had been
rigged</b> to steal the election from Donald Trump.
Dominion sued Fox News for libel.
Internal documents release during pre-trial discovery indicated that
top executives knew their claims were false.
Fox News did not present evidence that the machines were rigged
and ended up settling the case for $787 million.
