<h1>Election Fraud 2020</h1>

<p>Was the 2020 Election stolen from Donald Trump? Let's consider the evidence.
</p>

<p><b>The Heritage Foundation has recorded over 1500 cases of Election Fraud between 1982 and 2024.</b>
Many of these led to convictions. There are cases of fraud by both Republican and Democratic voters
in elections ranging from Mayoral and City Council races up to Presidential elections.

<p><b>Fox News reported that Dominion Voting Systems' machines had been
rigged</b> to steal the election from Donald Trump.
Dominion sued Fox News for defamation.
Internal documents released during pre-trial discovery showed that
top executives at Fox knew their claims were false.
Fox News did not present evidence that the machines were rigged
and ended up settling the case for $787 million.

<p><b>Rudy Giuliani claimed that a video showed two election workers in Georgia
were cheating</b> and scanning ballots multiple times. The two women received death threats.
They sued Giuliani, who conceded that his statements were false.
A jury awarded the election workers $148 million.

<p><b>The film 2000 Mules claimed to show Mark Andrews illegally voting multiple times</b> by mail.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigations found that he was mailing ballots for family members, which is legal.
Mr. Andrews filed a defamation lawsuit against Salem Media, the publishers of the film.
Salem agreed to settle the lawsuit and issued an apology to Mr. Andrews.
They also stopped distribution of the film and book.

<p><b>Arizona Recount:</b> At the urging of Trump supporters, the Arizona Senate hired Cyber Ninjas, a pro-Trump organization,
to recount their 2020 ballots.
Cyber Ninjas concluded that Biden won the Arizona election.
They also found an additional 361 votes for Biden.

<p><b>The Trump campaign filed 62 lawsuits relating to 2020 election fraud.</b>
Nearly all the suits were dismissed for lack of evidence or lack of standing.
They won one case related to voter identification but it was overturned by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

<p><b>Donald Trump has claimed that it was statistically impossible for Biden to have won in 2020.</b>
These claims were evaluated by Stanford Professor Justin Grimmer from the conservative Hoover Institution.
He found that the claims failed "to provide evidence of fraud or illegal voting".

<p><b>2020 Election Results for Swing States:</b> While there is some evidence of fraud by a handfull of individuals, these were not enough
to change the results in the Swing States. Biden won those by significant margins.
