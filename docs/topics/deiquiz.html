        question: `An ivy league college used race as a factor in admissions and considered
        minority status to be a plus.
        In 2023 the Supreme Court found that this was unlawful because of the Equal Protection Clause
        of the Constitution. But colleges could consider how race affected the student as an individual.
        <ul>
        <li>Some think that using race as a factor in admissions is GOOD because it increases diversity
        and helps train future minority leaders.</li>
        <li>Some think it is BAD because it discriminates against white students and may lead
        some people to assume that a minority student was unqualified and was only accepted
        because of a quota.</li>
        </ul>
        Do you think the use of race in admissions is ...`

        question: `The white male head of a large company had a group of advisors that
        were all white men. One day he had a bad idea but all the advisors thought it
        was a good idea. He followed it and the company failed. In his next company he
        hired a group of advisors that included women, minorities, foreigners, and
        others that were not like him.<br/>
        <ul>
        <li>Some think hiring diverse advisers is GOOD because someone in the group is more likely to have a different
        perspective and could spot bad ideas or come up with a better one.</li>
        <li>Some think this is BAD because they are more likely to disagree with one another.</li>
        </ul>
        Do you think hiring a diverse group of advisers is ...`

        question: `John Smith was a skilled accountant.
        One weekend he was injured in a car accident and became paralyzed.
        Luckily for John, the company he works
        for was required, under the Americans with Disability Act (ADA), to provide ramps for
        wheelchairs. So John was able to return to work.<br/>
        <ul>
        <li>Some think this requirement was GOOD because John was fully capable of being an
        accountant and just needed the ramp.</li>
        <li> Some think it is BAD because the ramps cost the company money and the government
        should not be telling companies what to do.</li>
        </ul>
        Do you think this requirement was ...`

        question: `Company XYZ used to focus their recruitment efforts on neighborhoods that
        happened to be mostly white. As a result, their new hires were mostly white. So they started recruiting
        in more neighborhoods with more minorities. As a result, more minorities applied and
        more qualified minority candidates were hired.
        <ul>
        <li>Some think this was GOOD because it resulted in a more diverse workforce and expanded their talent pool.</li>
        <li>Some think this was BAD because it cost the company more money for recruiting.</li>
        </ul>
        Do you think this was ...`

    {
        question: `Medical research used to focus primarily on white males. This resulted in
        medical problems specific to women being less well understood. Also diseases that tend
        to be found in minority or poor populations were sometimes ignored.
        Recently, research has increased its focus on women and minorities
        in an effort to balance things out. But the current NIH is cancelling funding
        for research grants that mention women, minorities, or economics.
        <ul>
        <li>Some think including women and minority in study groups GOOD because diseases
        like breast cancer or sickle cell anemia are not common in white men.</li>
        <li>Some think this is BAD because funding research on women or minorities discriminates agains white men.</li>
        </ul>
        Do you think that funding some medical research specifically for women and minorities is ...`

    {
        question: `A large company received complaints that their women employees were, on average, paid less
        than men for the same job and seniority. They created a DEI Department to analyze
        salaries across the company and raised the women's pay where needed to match the men's pay.
        <ul>
        <li>Some think this was GOOD because they think people should be paid the same amount for the same work.</li>
        <li>Some think this was BAD because they think women are more likely to have a husband that is paid well.</li>

        Do you think that equalizing pay for women is ...`

    {
        question: `When company XYZ interviews people for a job the interviewer writes  a
        report without using any "he" or "she" pronouns. The hiring committee does not see
        the candidates name and only reads the reports and recommendations from the interviews.
        This way the hiring decision is not based on race or sex.
        <ul>
        <li>Some think this is GOOD because it reduces the likelihood  of discrimination.</li>
        <li>Some think this is BAD because the people doing the hiring never meet the candidate face to face.</li>

        Do you think that removing clues about race and gender from the hiring process is ...`
